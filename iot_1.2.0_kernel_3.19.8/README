Brief
==================================
This work is based on original 'meta-clanton_v1.2.0.tar.gz' with several changes:
 - Linux Kernel is changes from 3.14.28 to 3.19.y
 - All kernel patches are adapted for Linux Kernel 3.19.8
 - CY8C9540A PWM range is increased up to 690880 us (or 1.44 Hz) (for Gen1 board only)
 - Robopeak USB display driver is added

Short instruction:

Compiling environment: VirtualBox, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

1. Unzip galileo-sources-master.zip to a folder
2. $ cd iot_1.2.0_kernel_3.19.8
3. Add execution rights
     $ chmod +x *.sh
     $ chmod +x setup/combo-layer
4. Using the root account execute
     # ./packets.sh
   to install required packets.
5. Setup git account. Or use default account like shown below:
     $ git config --global user.name "user"
     $ git config --global user.email "user@mail.local"
6. Using non-root account execute
     $ ./setup.sh
7. Execute using non-root account:
     $ source ./oe-init-build-env build
8. Edit files as needed
     ./build/conf/local.conf
     ./build/conf/bblayers.conf
9. Go to a directory
     ./build
10. Compile it using non-root account
     $ bitbake image-full
11. Take files from
     ./build/tmp/deploy/images/quark

Overview of Quark Software Release
==================================

Quark Software Release uses a combolayer script to combine
multiple git repos to form a Quark SW distro repo that can
be used for Quark platforms.

The aim of Quark Software Release is to lay down the foundation
for enabling Quark platforms. To align to Intel IoT Devkit initiative,
Quark Software Release has been refactored from older Quark repo folder/path
structure to follow Intel IoT Devkit.

Any developers interested in adopting Intel IoT Devkit repo can
obtain the repo from:
    git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-intel-iot-devkit

As Quark Software Release lays down the foundation for enabling
Quark platforms, core ingredients such as GRUB, kernel patches & etc
are also synced into the above Intel IoT Devkit repo regularly.

For developers that are interested in expanding the reference Quark distro
for other purposes, it is encouraged that developers familiarize with the
capability of Combo-layer as documented at:

https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Combo-layer

In fact, developers can customize setup/combolayer-quark.conf before setup.sh
script is executed to add in more files, folders or an entire new repo from
OpenEmbedded to form your own.

The current Quark SW repo dependency is as follows:

branch: dizzy
revision: refer to setup/combolayer-quark.conf

Installation
============
1) If you are behind corporate network proxy, please make sure your build machine is
   properly setup with network proxy information, for example:
   a) /etc/environment or ~/.bashrc are exporting the following environment variables:
      - export http_proxy=<proxy server IP|DNS>:<port>
      - export https_proxy=<proxy server IP|DNS>:<port>
      - export ftp_proxy=<proxy server IP|DNS>:<port>
      - export socks_server=<proxy server IP|DNS>:<port>
   b) ~/.gitconfig or GIT_PROXY_COMMAND is setup to point to proxy command for example:
      #!/bin/bash
       exec socat stdio SOCKS:<proxy server's IP|DNS>:$1:$2
  Note: you can skip the above configuration if you are not behind network proxy.

2) Make sure setup.sh is executable
  $ chmod +x setup.sh

3) Execute setup.sh script to automatically create Quark Software distro
  $ ./setup.sh
  Note: by default a git repo is setup after the new repo is created. If you are not
  interested to track your development change, you can simply remove ".git" folder.

What is repo-ext folder?
========================
As part of the meta layers setup steps, combolayer script is used to fetch in the
necessary git repo from remote sources into this folder. These repos are used to
generate the meta layers for building Linux OS for Quark product line.

Starting from Quark v1.2 release, this folder contains linux-stable repo which
is auto applied with LTSI patches as base too. This Linux kernel base is later
applied all Linux kernel patches (mixture of cherry-picked up-streamed patches
and forward-ported out-tree patches) for Quark SW release. By using this approach,
developer is encouraged to use the git repo as base for kernel patches contribution
back to Quark SW too. For ensuring linux-yocto-quark under your tmp/work folder
in synch with this locally hosted Linux kernel repo at repo-ext, developer should
perform the following steps:

$ bitbake linux-yocto-quark -f -c cleanall && bitbake linux-yocto-quark

Then, follow by the desired target image build as described below.

If developer is expert in using the linux kernel repo within tmp/work folder,
that is the quickest and most efficient way for kernel development. However,
developer should take caution in not wiping-out tmp/work folder accidentally.
Therefore, catering for disastrous mistake-proof, novice developer should use
repo-ext/linux-stable as Linux kernel development tree.


To uninstall software
=====================
1) Make sure unsetup.sh script is executable
   $ chmod +x unsetup.sh

2) Execute unsetup.sh script to automatically to revert your workspace to the original
   state after the software package is extracted.
   $ ./unsetup.sh

3) If your intention of unsetup the software is because you want to bring in more ingredients
   through the modified combolayer-quark.conf, please make sure you backup your previously
   committed patches on the git repo through "git format-patch". Then, remove the ".git"
   folder before calling setup.sh to create a new repo again. Finally, reapply your patch changes
   ontop of the newly created repo through "git am".

Building the software
=====================
1) source the repo environment
   $ source oe-init-build-env build
  Note: the above step will move your "pwd" to be under "build" folder.

2) To build an SD Card image
   $ bitbake image-full
  Note: the output of the build process is located under tmp/deploy/images/quark

3) To build a SPI flash image
   a) modify "build/conf/local.conf" as follow:
      DISTRO ?= "iot-devkit-spi"
      #DISTRO ?= "iot-devkit-multilibc"
   b) build a SPI flash image
      $ bitbake image-spi
